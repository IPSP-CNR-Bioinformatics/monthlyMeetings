1. Statistics do not tell us whether we are right. It tells us the **chances of being wrong**.

1. Samples are our **windows to the population**, and their statistics are used to estimate those of the population.

1. **Larger samples** approximate the population better.

1.  Always keep in mind that your **measurements are estimates**, which you should not endow with an aura of exactitude and finality. 

1. The **omnipresence of variability** will ensure that each sample will be different.

- The **mean** is calculated as the arithmetic average of values and can be unduly influenced by extreme values
  
- The **standard deviation** is calculated based on the square of the distance of each value from the mean

- The **median** is a more robust measure of location and more suitable for distributions that are skewed or otherwise irregularly shaped

### Use boxplot to illustrate the spread and differences of samples

---

## Box plots

1. Visualization methods **enhance our understanding** of sample data and help us make comparisons across samples

1. Box plot is a method for graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their **quartiles**

  - A quartile is a type of quantile which **divides the number of data points into four more or less equal parts**, or quarters. 
    
  - The **first quartile** (Q1) is defined as the middle number between the smallest number and the median of the data set

  - The **interquartile range** (IQR = Q3 − Q1), which covers the central 50% of the data
  
  - Quartiles are **insensitive to outliers** and preserve information about the center and spread

???

- The **core element** that gives the box plot its name is a box whose length is the **IQR** and whose width is arbitrary

- A line inside the box shows the **median**, which is not necessarily central

- The plot may be oriented **vertically or horizontally**

- **Whiskers** are conventionally extended to the most extreme data point that is no more than 1.5 × IQR from the edge of the box (Tukey style) or all the way to minimum and maximum of the data values (Spear style)

- The **1.5 multiplier** corresponds to 99.3% coverage of the data for a normal distribution

- **Outliers** beyond the whiskers may be individually plotted.

- Box plot construction requires a **sample of at least n = 5** (preferably larger)
---

## Final considerations

1. For small sample sizes boxplots do not necessarily represent the distribution well

.center[

]

1. Strongly discourage using bar plots with error bars 

  - These charts continue to be prevalent (we counted 100 figures that used them in 2013 Nature Methods papers, compared to only 20 that used box plots)
  
  - The choice of baseline can interfere with assessing relative sizes of means and their error bars

# Part II


### How uncertainty is represented

---

## Error bars

1. The **uncertainty** in estimates is customarily represented using error bars

1. A lot of **misconceptions** persist about how error bars relate to statistical significance

1. When asked to estimate the required separation between two points with error bars for a difference at significance P = 0.05, **only 22% of respondents were correct**

## Error bars

- **Standard deviation**: it shows how the data are spread

- **Standard error**: it describes how accurate the mean estimate is

- **Confident intervals**: it captures the true mean μ on 95% of occasions

# Error bar rules

- When showing error bars, always describe
in the **figure legends** what they are.

- Error bars and statistics
should only be shown for **independently repeated experiments**, and never for replicates
]

???

- Consider trying to determine whether **deletion of a gene in mice affects tail length**. 

- We could choose **one mutant mouse and one wild type**

- **Perform 20 replicate measurements** of each of their tails. 

- We could **calculate the means, SDs, and SEs** of the replicate measurements, but these would **not permit us to answer the central question** of whether gene deletion affects tail length, **because n would equal 1 for each genotype**, no matter how often each tail was measured

.small[
- Experimental biologists
are usually trying to compare experimental results with controls, it is usually
**appropriate to show inferential error bars**, such as SE or CI, rather than SD
]

--

.small[
- 95% CIs capture μ on 95%
of occasions, so you can be 95% confident your interval includes μ
]

--

.small[
- When n = 3, and double the
SE bars don’t overlap, P < 0.05, and if
double the SE bars just touch, P is close to
0.05
]

# Conclusion

1. Error bars can be valuable for understanding results and deciding whether the authors’ **conclusions are justified by the data**

--

1. When first seeing a figure with error bars, ask yourself:
  - What is n?
  - Are they independent experiments, or just replicates?
  - What kind of error bars are they?
