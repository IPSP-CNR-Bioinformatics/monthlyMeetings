# Monty Hall problem

No other statistical puzzle comes so close to fooling all the people all the time [and] even Nobel physicists systematically give the wrong answer]

## Game show

- You are given the choice of three doors
 
--

- Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats.
  
--

- You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what is behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat.
  
--

- He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?".

La statistica non da un numero che ci dice se abbiamo ragione o meno, la statistica da un range di probabilita. Da incertezza
