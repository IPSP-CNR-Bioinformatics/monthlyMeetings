## Perche incontri sulla statistica?

- approximately half the articles published in medical journals that use statistical methods use them incorrectly

# Monty Hall problem

## Game show

- You are given the choice of three doors
 
--

- Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats.
  
--

- You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what is behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat.
  
--

- He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?".

# Sampling and uncertainty

#### How samples are used to estimate population statistics and what this means in terms of uncertainty

### Descriptive

- summarizes the main features of a data set

- measures such as the mean and standard deviation
]
]



.pull-right[
.small[
### Inferential

- generalizes from observed data

- make inferences about the population

Underpinning both are the concepts of sampling and estimation: 

- collecting data

- quantifying the uncertainty

# Population

.bold[
Set of all entities about which we make inferences

The frequency histogram of all possible values is called the **population distribution**.

### We are typically interested in inferring:

.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://imgur.com/D9etism.png")
```
]

- The **mean** is calculated as the arithmetic average of values and can be unduly influenced by extreme values
  
- The **standard deviation** is calculated based on the square of the distance of each value from the mean

- The **median** is a more robust measure of location and more suitable for distributions that are skewed or otherwise irregularly shaped

## PROBLEM
]

<br>

.content-box-grey[
.center[Fiscal and practical constraints limit our access to the population! 

We cannot directly measure the mean and the s.d.

The best we can do is estimate them using **collected data through the process of sampling**

## SAMPLING

.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/Y2nst5N.png")
```
]


- Samples are sets of data drawn from the population, characterized by the number of data points n, usually denoted by X and indexed by a numerical subscript. 

- Larger samples approximate the population better.

- To maintain validity, the sample must be representative of the population.

## 1936 USA Presidential Election

### Central event in the history of statistics and polling

### Literary Digest

### Statistician George Gallup

- 0.05M people sample

- Democratic Franklin D. Roosevelt wins 

- With 0.003M he replicated the results of Literary Digest
]
]

--

1. Roosevelt won
 
1. Literary Digest ceased publishing within a few months of the election

## SAMPLING

.large[Random sampling]

--

- where all values in the population have an equal chance of being selected at each stage of the sampling process.

--

- Representative does not mean that the sample is a miniature replica of the population.

--

- A sample will not resemble the population unless n is very large.

--

#### When constructing a sample, it is not always obvious whether it is free from bias.

## Central Limit Theorem

.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/Y2nst5N.png")
```
]

.small[

- Notice that the distribution of sample means looks quite different than the population one

- It appears similar in shape to a normal distribution.

- Also notice that its spread, is quite a bit smaller than that of the population

--

.content-box-red[
.center[
.large[
Despite these differences, the population and sampling distributions are intimately related

## Central Limit Theorem

.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/Y2nst5N.png")
```
]

- The CLT tells us that the distribution of sample means (Fig. 2c) will become increasingly close to a normal distribution as the sample size increases
  
- Regardless of the shape of the population distribution (Fig. 2a) as long as the frequency of extreme values drops off quickly.

<br>

--

- The CLT also relates population and sample distribution parameters 

.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/Fu7pPpT.png")
```
]

???

delta X:  is the spread of sample means

delta: is the spread of the underlying population.

As we increase n: delta X will decrease (our samples will have more similar means) but delta will not change (sam-pling has no effect on the population)

## A demonstration of the CLT for different population distributions

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/IFJmWIP.png")
```
]

- Increase in precision of our estimate of the population mean with increase in sample size

- Notice that it is still possible for a sample mean to fall far from the population mean, especially for small n

.content-box-grey[
For example, with samples of size n = 3 from the irregular distribution, the number of times the sample mean fell outside the standard deviation interval ranged from 7.6% to 8.6%.

## CONCLUSION
]

.small[
- Always keep in mind that your **measurements are estimates**, which you should not endow with an aura of exactitude and finality. 
]

--

.small[
- The **omnipresence of variability** will ensure that each sample will be different.
